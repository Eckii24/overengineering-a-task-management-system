# Lightning Talk: Self-Organization Extreme: Over engineering a Task Management System

## Abstract
In an increasingly complex world, effective self-organization is essential for achieving personal and professional success. 
This presentation explores my comprehensive self-organization system, which includes key components such as defined Areas, 
ongoing Projects, essential Resources, and actionable Tasks. These foundational elements work together to enhance productivity and clarity in my daily life.

Additionally, I will discuss the alignment of my activities with my long-term aspirations through Guiding Principles, Goals, Objectives and Key Results. 
The presentation will also cover my structured review process, which includes Annual, Quarterly, Monthly, Weekly, and Daily reflections. 
Together, these elements create a robust framework for continuous improvement and effective goal achievement.

# Structured Outline for a Lightning Talk on Productivity

## Introduction
- Provocative start with the quote "You can never do anything"
- Present the absurd idea that productivity systems actually don't work
- Seemingly ending the talk as an attention grabber

## Basics of Task Management
- **Getting Things Done (GTD) Method**
  - Core principle: Write everything down to keep the mind free
  - Context-based work as a second important aspect

## Project Organization
- Grouping related tasks into projects
- Introduction of Daily and Weekly Reviews as control instruments

## Task Prioritization
- **Covey Matrix (Important vs. Urgent)**
  - The four quadrants as prioritization aid
  - Connection to the "7 Habits of Highly Effective People"

## Long-term Goal Alignment
- From individual tasks to overarching goals
- The 12 principles for effective self-management
- Presentation of the personal Full-Plone system

## Methodical Goal Setting
- **Odyssey Plan** as a tool for long-term planning
- Reference to "4000 Weeks" (presumably "Four Thousand Weeks" by Oliver Burkeman)
- Technical implementation: Breaking down goals into different time units

## Summary
- From small (tasks) to large (goals)
- The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a connecting element
- The necessity of a well-thought-out task management system

## Conclusion
- Thanks for listening and possibly room for questions

## Alternative/Additive Ideas:
- Highlight core topics individually via agenda points:
  - Task management
  - Goal management
  - Review system
  - Journaling (derived from the 7th habit)
- More or less derived from Covey
- Build the tension arc on what the system ideally needs to be able to do
- Show concrete implementation at the end
